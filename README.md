# Image Comparator

Image comparator which computes similarity between images to detect duplicates on the Android platform. It uses the OpenCV manager and different algorithms to compare images and help you find an optimized method to detect duplicate images for your application.

Image comparison is optimized with the following parameters:
->Minimum distance between keypoints described to be accepted as duplicates. The lower, the higher the chances of the images being duplicate.
->Different algorithms like SURF, SIFT, ORB, BRIEF, etc. The different algorithms have their own benefits, so you can pick the one you require. Speed or accuracy being the main criteria.

It is used in my application [WhatsAppDuplicateMediaRemover] (http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.torcellite.whatsappduplicatemediaremover)

# To be added
